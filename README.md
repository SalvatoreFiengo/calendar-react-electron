This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm run electron .`
Run an Electron instance, a desktop app version of what is running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
For now, I am still working on the project therefore please run `npm start` then in a new terminal `npm run electron .` to test it.
Thanks

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
